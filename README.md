This project leverages advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to accurately predict various skin diseases from images. Using transfer learning with pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system classifies skin conditions such as benign and malignant types of cancer related cells with high accuracy. Data augmentation and preprocessing improve model robustness, while explainable AI methods help interpret predictions for better clinical understanding. The goal is to provide an accessible, fast, and affordable diagnostic support tool for early skin disease detection, particularly useful in areas with limited access to dermatologists.
